# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, written in Rust. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and improve my problem-solving and complexity-analysing skills through coding challenges. 

## Structure

The solutions are stored in /src/bin and can be run using ```bash cargo run --bin <name_of_solution>``` (assuming rust/cargo is installed)

The solutions are organized by the order I solved them rather than the order listed on LeetCode. This approach allows me to track my development over time.

Note that files exists with duplicate names (i.e. 001_two_sum.rs & 003_two_sum.rs), this means I thought of another solution.
